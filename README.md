### MemberSkins
Allows users to change their skins on an eso forum locally as if they were userscripts.

Because of how skins normally modify parts of the forum, they have to be changed by an administrator.  This plugin applies the stylesheet of a particular skin that's been installed on your forum and lets a user wear it.
